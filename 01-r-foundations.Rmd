# R Foundations

Meaningful data analysis requires the use of computer software. 

R statistical software is one of the most popular tools for data analysis both in academia and the broader workforce. In what follows, I will attempt to lay a foundation of basic knowledge and skills with R that you will need for data analysis. I make no attempt to be exhaustive, and many other important aspects of using R (like plotting) will be discussed later, as needed.

## What is R?

* R is programming language and environment designed for statistical computing.
  * It was introduced by Robert Gentleman and Robert Ihaka in 1993.
  * It is modeled after the _S_ programming language.
* R is free, open source, and runs on Windows, Macs, Linux, and other types of computers.
* R is an interactive programming language
  * You type and execute a command in the Console for immediate feedback in contrast to a compiled programming language, which compiles a program that is then executed.
* R is highly extendable.
  * Many user-created packages are available to extend the functionality beyond what is installed by default.
  * Users can write their own functions and easily add software libraries to R.

## Where to get R (and R Studio Desktop)

R may be downloaded from the R Project's [website](https://www.r-project.org/). This [link](https://cloud.r-project.org/) *should* bring you to the relevant page for downloading the software.

R Studio Desktop is a free "front end" for R provided by [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/). R Studio Desktop makes doing data analysis with R much easier by adding an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and providing many other features. Currently, you may download R Studio at this [link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You may need to navigate the R Studio website directly if this link no longer functions.

Install R and R Studio Desktop before continuing. Then open R Studio Desktop as you continue to learn about R.

## R Studio Layout

R Studio Desktop has four panes:

1. Console: the pane where the code is executed.
2. Source: the pane where you prepare commands to be executed.
3. Environment/History: the pane where you can see all the objects in your workspace, your command history, and other things.
4. The Files/Plot/Packages/Help: the pane where you navigate between directories, where plots can be viewed, where you can see the packages available to be loaded, and where you can get help.

<!-- ![RStudio panes](pictures/rstudio_panes.png) -->
To see all R Studio panes, press the keys `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + 0`

## Running code, scripts, and comments
Code is executed in R by typing it in the Console and hitting enter.

Instead of typing all of your code in the Console and hitting enter, it's better to write your code in a Script and execute the code separately.

A new script can be obtained by executing File -> New File -> R Script or pressing "Ctrl + Shift + n" (on a PC) or "Cmd + Shift + n" on a Mac.

There are various ways to run code from a Script file. The most common ones are:

1. Highlight the code you want to run and hit the Run button at the top of the Script pane.
2. Highlight the code you want to run and press "Ctrl + Enter" on your keyboard. If you don't highlight anything, by default, R Studio runs the command the cursor currently lies on.

To save a script, click File -> Save or press "Ctrl + s" (on a PC) or "Cmd + s" (on a Mac).

A comment is a set of text ignored by R when submitted to the Console.

A comment is indicated by the `#` symbol. Nothing to the right of the `#` is executed in the Console.

To comment (or uncomment) multiple lines in R, highlight the code you want to comment and press "Ctrl + Shift + c" on a PC or "Cmd + Shift + c" on a Mac.

### Example {.example}
Perform the following tasks:

1. Type `1+1` in the Console and hit enter.
2. Open a new Script in R Studio.
3. `mean(1:3)` in your Script file.
4. Type `# mean(1:3)` in your Script file.
5. Run the commands from the Script using an approach mentioned above.

## Packages
Packages are collections of functions, data, and other objects that extend the functionality installed by default in R. 

R packages can be installed using the `install.packages` function and loaded using the `library` function.

### Example {.example}
Practice installing and loading a package by doing the following:

1. Install the set of **faraway** package by executing the command
`install.packages("faraway")`.
2. Load the **faraway** package by executing the command `library(faraway)`. 

## Getting help

There are a number of helps to get help in R.

If you know the command for which you want help, then exectue `?command` in the Console.
  * e.g., `?lm`
  * This also may work with data sets, package names, object classes, etc.

If you want to search the documentation for a certain *topic*, then execute `??topic` in the Console.
* If you need help deciphering an error, identifying packages to perform a certain analysis, how to do something better, then a web search is likely to help.

### Example {.example}

Do the following:

1. Execute `?lm` in the Console to get help on the `lm` function, which is one of the main functions used for fitting linear models.
2. Execute `??logarithms` in the Console to search the R documentation for information about logarithms.
3. Do a web search for something along the lines of "How do I change the size of the axis labels in an R plot?".

## Data types and structures

### Basic data types
R has 6 basic ("atomic") [vector types](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Basic-types):

1. character - collections of characters. E.g., `"a"`, `"hello world!"`
2. double - decimal numbers. e.g., `1.2`, `1.0`
3. integer - whole numbers. In R, you must add `L` to the end of a number to specify it as an integer. E.g., `1L` is an integer but `1` is a double.
4. logical - boolean values, `TRUE` and `FALSE`
5. complex - complex numbers. E.g., `1+3i`
6. raw - a type to hold raw bytes.

The `typeof` function returns the R internal type or storage mode of any object.

Consider the following commands and output:
```{r}
# determine basic data type
typeof(1)
typeof(1L)
typeof("hello world!")
```

### Other important object types

There are other important types of objects in R that are not basic. We will discuss a few. The [R Project manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Basic-types) provides additional information about available types.

#### Numeric
An object is `numeric` if it is of type `integer` or `double`. In that case, it's `mode` is said to be `numeric`.

The `is.numeric` function tests whether an object can be interpreted as numbers. We can use it to determine whether an object is `numeric`.

Some examples:

```{r}
# is the object numeric?
is.numeric("hello world!")
is.numeric(1)
is.numeric(1L)
```

#### NULL
`NULL` is a special object to indicate an object is absent. An object having a length of zero is not the same thing as an object being absent.

#### NA
A "missing value" occurs when the value of something isn't known. R uses the special object `NA` to represent missing value.

If you have a missing value, you should represent that value as `NA`. Note: `"NA"` is not the same thing as `NA`.

#### Functions
A function is an object the performs a certain action or set of actions based on objects it receives from its arguments.

### Data structures

R operates on data structures.  A data structure is simply some sort of "container" that holds certain kinds of information

R has 5 basic data structures:

* vector
* matrix
* array
* data frame
* list

Vectors, matrices, and arrays are homogeneous objects that can only store a single data type at a time.

Data frames and lists can store multiple data types.

Vectors and lists are considered one-dimensional objects. A list is technically a vector. Vectors of a single type are atomic vectors. (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#List-objects)

Matrices and data frames are considered two-dimensional objects.

Arrays can be n-dimensional objects.

This is summarized in the table below, which is based on a [table](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#data-structure) in the first edition of Hadley Wickham's *Advanced R*.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(data.frame(dimensionality = c("1d", "2d", "nd"),
                        homogeneous = c("vector", "matrix", "array"),
                        heterogeneous = c("list", "data frame", "")))
```

## Assignment

To store a data structure in the computer's memory we must assign it a name.

Data structures can be stored using the assignment operator `<-` or `=`.

Some comments:
  
* In general, both `<-` and `=` can be used for assignment.
* Pressing the "Alt" and "-" keys simultaneously on a PC or Linux machine (Option and - on a Mac) will insert `<-` into the R console and script files.
  * If you are creating an R Markdown file, then this command will only insert `<-` if you are in an R computing environment.
* `<-` and `=` are NOT synonyms, but can be used identically most of the time. It's safest to use `<-` for assignment.

Once an object has been assigned a name, it can be printed by executing the name of the object or using the `print` function.

### Example
In the following code, we compute the mean of a vector and print the result.
```{r}
# compute the mean of 1, 2, ..., 10 and assign the name m
m <- mean(1:10) 
m # print m
print(m) # print m a different way
```

## Vectors
A *vector* is a single-dimensional set of data of the same type.

### Creation
The most basic way to create a vector is the `c` function.

The `c` function combines values into a vector or list.

e.g., the following commands create vectors of type numeric, character, and logical, respectively.

* `c(1, 2, 5.3, 6, -2, 4)`
* `c("one", "two", "three")`
* `c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)`

### Creating patterned vectors

R provides a number of functions for creating vectors following certain consistent patterns.

The `seq` (sequence) function is used to create an equidistant series of numeric values.

Some examples:
  
* `seq(1, 10)`: A sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 in increments of 1.
* `1:10`: A sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 in increments of 1.
* `seq(1, 20, by = 2)`: A sequence of numbers from 1 to 20 in increments of 2.
* `seq(10, 20, len = 100)`: A sequence of numbers from 10 to 20 of length 100.

The `rep` (replicate) function can be used to create a vector by replicating values.

Some examples:
  
  * `rep(1:3, times = 3)`: Repeat the sequence 1, 2, 3 three times in a row.
* `rep(c("trt1", "trt2", "trt3"), times = 1:3)`: Repeat "trt1" once, "trt2" twice, and "trt3" three times.
* `rep(1:3, each = 3)`: Repeat each element of the sequence 1, 2, 3 three times.

### Example {.example}
Execute the following commands in the Console to see what you get.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# vector creation
c(1, 2, 5.3, 6, -2, 4)
c("one", "two", "three")
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
# sequences of values
seq(1, 10)
1:10
seq(1, 20, by = 2)
seq(10, 20, len = 100)
# replicated values
rep(1:3, times = 3)
rep(c("trt1", "trt2", "trt3"), times = 1:3)
rep(1:3, each = 3)
```

Vectors can be combined into a new object using the `c` function.

### Example {.example}
Execute the following commands in the Console

```{r}
v1 <- 1:5 # create a vector
v1 # print the vector
print(v1)
v2 <- c(1, 10, 11) # create a new vector
new <- c(v1, v2) # combine and assign the combined vectors
new # print the combined vector
```

### Categorical vectors

Categorical data should be stored as a `factor` in R.

The `factor` function takes values that can be coerced to a character and converts them to an object of class `factor`.

Some examples:
```{r}
# create some factor variables
f1 <- factor(rep(1:6, times = 3))
f1
f2 <- factor(c("a", 7, "blue", "blue", FALSE))
f2
```

### Example {.example}

Create a vector named `grp` that has two levels: `a` and `b`, where the first 7 values are `a` and the second 4 values are `b`.

### Extracting parts of a vector
Subsets of the elements of a vector can be extracted by appending an index vector in square brackets `[]` to the name of the vector .

Let's create the numeric vector 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

```{r}
# define a sequence 2, 4, ..., 16
a <- seq(2, 16, by = 2)
a
``` 

Let's access the 2nd, 4th, and 6th elements of `a`.
```{r}
# extract subset of vector
a[c(2, 4, 6)]
```

Let's access all elements in `a` EXCEPT the 2nd, 4th, and 6th using the minus (`-`) sign in front of the index vector.
```{r}
# extract subset of vector using minus
a[-c(2, 4, 6)]
```

Let's access all elements in `a` except elements 3 through 6.
```{r}
a[-(3:6)]
```

## Helpful functions

### General functions

Some general functions commonly used to describe data objects:

* `length(x)`: length of `x`
* `sum(x)`: sum elements in `x`
* `mean(x)`: sample mean of elements in `x`
* `var(x)`: sample variance of elements in `x`
* `sd(x)`: sample standard deviation of elements in `x`
* `range(x)`: range (minimum and maximum) of elements in `x`
* `log(x)`: (natural) logarithm of elements in `x`
* `summary(x)`: a summary of `x`. Output changes depending on the class of `x`.
* `str(x)`: provides information about the structure of `x`. Usually, the class of the object and some information about its size.

### Example {.example}

Run the following commands in the Console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# common functions
x <- rexp(100) # sample 100 iid values from an Exponential(1) distribution
length(x) # length of x
sum(x) # sum of x
mean(x) # sample mean of x
var(x) # sample variance of x
sd(x) # sample standard deviation of x
range(x) # range of x
log(x) # logarithm of x
summary(x) # summary of x
str(x) # structure of x
```

### Functions related to statistical distributions

Suppose that a random variable $X$ has the `dist` distribution:
  
*	`p[dist](q, ...)`: returns the cdf of $X$ evaluated at `q`, i.e., $p=P(X\leq q)$.
*	`q[dist](p, ...)`: returns the inverse cdf (or quantile function) of $X$ evaluated at $p$, i.e., $q = \inf\{x: P(X\leq x) \geq p\}$.
* `d[dist](x, ...)`: returns the mass or density of $X$  evaluated at $x$ (depending on whether it's discrete or continuous).
* `r[dist](n, ...)`: returns an i.i.d. random sample of size `n` having the same distribution as $X$.
* The `...` indicates that additional arguments describing the parameters of the distribution may be required.

Execute `?Distributions` to get information about the distributions available in R by default.

### Example {.example}

Execute the following commands in R to see the output. What is each command doing?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# statistical calculations
pnorm(1.96, mean = 0, sd = 1)
qunif(0.6, min = 0, max = 1)
dbinom(2, size = 20, prob = .2)
dexp(1, rate = 2)
rchisq(100, df = 5)
```

* `pnorm(1.96, mean = 0, sd = 1)` returns the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 1.96, i.e., $P(X \leq 1.96)$.
* `qunif(0.6, min = 0, max = 1)` returns the value $x$ such that $P(X\leq x) = 0.6$ for a uniform random variable on the interval $[0, 1]$.
* `dbinom(2, size = 20, prob = .2)` returns the probability that $P(X=2)$ for $X~\textrm{Binom}(n=20,\pi=0.2)$.
* `dexp(1, rate = 2)` evaluates the density of an exponential random variable with mean = 1/2 at $x=1$.
* `rchisq(100, df = 5)` returns a sample of 100 observations from a chi-squared random variable with 5 degrees of freedom.

## Data Frames

Data frames are two-dimensional data objects. Each column of a data frame is a vector (or variable) of possibly different data types. This is a *fundamental* data structure used by most of R's modeling software. 

In general, I recommend *tidy data*, which means that each variable forms a column of the data frame, and each observation forms a row.

### Creation
Data frames are created by passing vectors into the `data.frame` function.

The names of the columns in the data frame are the names of the vectors you give the `data.frame` function.

Consider the following simple example.

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
# create basic data frame
d <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
e <- c("red", "white", "blue", NA)
f <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
df <- data.frame(d,e,f)
df
```

The columns of a data frame can be renamed using the `names` function on the data frame.

```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
# name columns of data frame
names(df) <- c("ID", "Color", "Passed")
df
```

The columns of a data frame can be named when you are first creating the data frame by using `name =` for each vector of data.
```{r, paged.print=FALSE}
# create data frame with better column names
df2 <- data.frame(ID = d, Color = e, Passed = f)
df2
```

### Extracting parts of a data frame
The column vectors of a data frame may be extracted using `$` and specifying the name of the desired vector.

* `df$Color` would access the `Color` column of data frame `df`.

Part of a data frame can also be extracted by thinking of at as a general matrix and specifying the desired rows or columns in square brackets after the object name. For example, if we had a data frame named `df`:

* `df[1,]` would access the first row of `df`.
* `df[1:2,]` would access the first two rows of `df`.
* `df[,2]` would access the second column of `df`.
* `df[1:2, 2:3]` would access the information in rows 1 and 2 of columns 2 and 3 of `df`.

If you need to select multiple columns of a data frame by name, you can pass a character vector with column names in the column position of `[]`.

* `df[, c("Color", "Passed")]` would extract the `Color` and `Passed` columns of df.

### Example {.example}

Execute the following commands in the Console:
```{r, eval=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
# Extract parts of a data frame
df3 <- data.frame(numbers = 1:5,
                  characters = letters[1:5],
                  logicals = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE))
df3 # print df
df3$logicals # access the logicals vector of df3
df3[1, ] # access the first column of df3
df3[, 3] # access the third column of df3
df3[, 2:3] # access the column 2 and 3 of df3
df3[, c("numbers", "logicals")] # access the numbers and logical columns of df3
```

Students often can work more conveniently with vectors, so it is sometimes desirable to access a part of a data frame and assign it a new name for later use. For example, to access the `ID` column of `df2` and assign it the name `newID`, we could execute `newID <- df2$ID`.

### Importing Data

The `read.table` function imports data from file into R as a data frame.

Usage: `read.table(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",")`

* `file` is the file path and name of the file you want to import into R.
  * If you don't know the file path, set `file = file.choose()` will bring up a dialog box asking you to locate the file you want to import.
* `header` specifies whether the data file has a header (variable labels for each column of data in the first row of the data file).
  * If you don't specify this option in R or use `header = FALSE`, then R will assume the file doesn't have any headings.
  * `header = TRUE` tells R to read in the data as a data frame with column names taken from the first row of the data file.
* `sep` specifies the delimiter separating elements in the file.
  * If each column of data in the file is separated by a space, then use `sep = " "`
  * If each column of data in the file is separated by a comma, then use `sep = ","`
  * If each column of data in the file is separated by a tab, then use `sep = "\t"`.

Here is an example reading a csv (comma separated file) with a header:
  
```{r}
# import data as data frame
dtf <- read.table(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrench/DataWrangleViz/master/data/covid_dec4.csv",
                  header = TRUE,
                  sep = ",")
str(dtf)
```

Note that the `read_table` function in the **readr** package and the `fread` function in the **data.table** package are perhaps better ways of reading in tabular data and use similar syntax.

## Logical statements

### Basic comparisons
Sometimes we need to know if the elements of an object satisfy certain conditions.  This can be determined using the logical operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`.

* `==` means equal to.
* `!=` means NOT equal to.

### Example {.example}

Execute the following commands in R and see what you get. What is each statement performing?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# logical statements
# a <- seq(2, 16, by = 2) # creating the vector a
a
a > 10
a <= 4
a == 10
a != 10
```

### And and Or statements
More complicated logical statements can be made using `&` and `|`.

* `&` means "and"
  * Only `TRUE & TRUE` returns `TRUE`. Otherwise the `&` operator returns `FALSE`.
* `|` means "or"
  * Only a single value in an `|` statement needs to be true for `TRUE` to be returned.

Note that:

* `TRUE & TRUE` returns `TRUE`
* `FALSE & TRUE` returns `FALSE`
* `FALSE & FALSE` returns `FALSE`
* `TRUE | TRUE` returns `TRUE`
* `FALSE | TRUE` returns `TRUE`
* `FALSE | FALSE` returns `FALSE`

```{r}
# relationship between logicals & (and), | (or)
TRUE & TRUE
FALSE & TRUE
FALSE & FALSE
TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
FALSE | FALSE
```

### Example
Execute the following commands in R and see what you get.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# complex logical statements
(a > 6) & (a <= 10)
(a <= 4) | (a >= 12)
```

## Subsetting with logical statements

Logical statements can be used to return parts of an object satisfying the appropriate criteria. Specifically, we pass logical statements within the square brackets used to access part of a data structure.

### Example

Execute the following code:
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# accessing parts of a vector using logicals
a
a < 6
a[a < 6]
a == 10
a[a == 10]
(a < 6) | ( a == 10)
a[(a < 6) | ( a == 10)]
# accessing parts of a data frame
# create a logical vector based on whether
# a state_abb in dtf is "CA" or "CO"
ca_or_co <- is.element(dtf$state_abb, c("CA", "CO"))
ca_or_co
# access the CA and CA rows of dtf
dtf[ca_or_co,]
```

## Ecosystem debate

We will typically work with **base** R, which are commands and functions R offers by default.

The **tidyverse** ([https://www.tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org)) is a collection of R packages that provides a unified framework for data manipulation and visualization.

Since this course focuses more on modeling than data manipulation, I will typically focus on approaches in **base** R. I will use functions from the **tidyverse** when it greatly simplifies analysis, data manipulation, or visualization.
